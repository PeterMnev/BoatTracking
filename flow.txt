Flow

1: Initiate main class (Thread 0)

Contains variables: video_capture, various telemetry variables, drone

- Thread 1: Neural net wrapper - every 12 seconds uses video_capture object to determine boat location
- Thread 2: Uses video_capture object to perform interpolation of where the boat might be, continuously


Thread 0: Continuously updates telemetry data and computes boat position based on image proc (in future, will use moving averages as well), issues commands to drone 


Considerations: if laggy, put the self state update in its own separate thread.
